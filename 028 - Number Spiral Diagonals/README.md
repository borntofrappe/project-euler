# [Number Spiral Diagonals](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-28-number-spiral-diagonals)

## Problem

> Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
>
> 21 22 23 24 25
>
> 20 7 8 9 10
>
> 19 6 1 2 11
>
> 18 5 4 3 12
>
> 17 16 15 14 13
>
> It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
>
> What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a n by n spiral formed in the same way?

## Setup

```js
function spiralDiagonals(n) {
  // Good luck!
  return n;
}

spiralDiagonals(1001);
```
