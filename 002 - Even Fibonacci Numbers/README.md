# [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-2-even-fibonacci-numbers)

## Problem

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Setup

```js
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  // You can do it!
  return true;
}

fiboEvenSum(10);
```
