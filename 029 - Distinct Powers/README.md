# [Distinct Powers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-29-distinct-powers)

## Problem

> Consider all integer combinations of ab for `2 ≤ a ≤ 5` and `2 ≤ b ≤ 5`:
>
> 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32
>
> 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243
>
> 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024
>
> 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125
>
> If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
>
> 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
>
> How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for `2 ≤ a ≤ n` and `2 ≤ b ≤ n`?

## Setup

```js
function distinctPowers(n) {
  // Good luck!
  return n;
}

distinctPowers(30);
```

## Notice

At the time of writing, the problem described on the [freeCodeCamp platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-29-distinct-powers) incorrectly describes the various powers (showing `22` instead of `2^2` for instance). Looking at the [project euler website](https://projecteuler.net/problem=29), I updated the description to match.
