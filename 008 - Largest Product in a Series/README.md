# [Largest Product in a Series](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-8-largest-product-in-a-series)

## Problem

> The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.
>
> Find the `n` adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?

## Setup

```js
function largestProductinaSeries(n) {
  // Good luck!
  let thousandDigits = [];
  return true;
}

largestProductinaSeries(13);
```

## Notes

Please note that the `thousandDigits` array is supposed to contain one thousand digits, as specified [in the problem on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-8-largest-product-in-a-series). I preferred not to include the entire data structure just to save me the pain of cluttering the notes.
