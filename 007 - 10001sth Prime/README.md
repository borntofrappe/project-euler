# [10001st Prime](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-7-10001st-prime)

## Problem

> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
>
> What is the `n`-th prime number?

## Setup

```js
function nthPrime(n) {
  // Good luck!
  return true;
}

nthPrime(10001);
```
