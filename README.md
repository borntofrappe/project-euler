# #ProjectEuler100

⚠️ Contains spoilers ⚠️

In this repo I set out to hopefully solve and document my endeavors in the #projecteuler100 challenge.

Inspired by [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-new-years-resolution-guide/#the-projecteuler100-challenge-the-dark-souls-of-new-year-s-resolutions) from [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia), the idea is to go through the first 100 problems from the Euler project.

The problems are tackled on the [freeCodeCamp platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/).

By the end of the challenge, I hope to have new insight into JavaScript and a new perspective on programming. I also hope that mathematics won't force me to withdraw from achieving what promises to be a rewarding challenge.
